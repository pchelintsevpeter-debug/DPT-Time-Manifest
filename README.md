# DPT-Time-Manifest
Digital Planetary Time - A unified planetary time, ideal for synchronizing AI, robots, autopilot, exchanges, transactions, international reports, etc.

📘 DPT-Time SDK — Digital Planetary Time for Machines and Contracts

DPT-Time is a universal digital calendar system designed for machines, autonomous systems, smart contracts, and global automation.
It works independently from human perception of time, providing a stable and uniform time flow for algorithms and AI systems.

The DPT calendar is based on 360 digital days per year and 864,000 digital seconds (Pt-seconds) per day.
Each new DPT year begins at the vernal equinox, forming a perfectly cyclic and repeatable time model.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Fixed 360-day year, no leap years or astronomical drift
✅ 1000+ years of temporal stability without cumulative errors
✅ Automatic year generation (based on vernal equinox cycles)
✅ Full reversibility between UTC ↔ DPT
✅ Ideal for business logic, AI agents, autonomous vehicles, and smart contracts

⚙️ DPT Time Structure
Unit	Symbol	Equivalent
1 Pt-second	1 pt	0.1 s
1 Pt-minute	360 pt	36 s
1 Pt-octave	3600 pt	6 min
1 Pt-hour	36000 pt	1 h
1 Digital Day	864000 pt	≈ 24 h (± few seconds)
1 Digital Year	360 days	≈ 365 solar days

💡 Note:
The duration of a digital day (in real seconds) may slightly vary each year,
depending on the astronomical cycle between two vernal equinoxes.
This ensures smooth long-term synchronization with the Earth's orbital motion
without any leap-day or correction mechanisms.

🧠 How It Works

Each DPT year is dynamically generated based on the precise period
between one vernal equinox and the next.
The system does not store millions of static manifests —
it computes the year dynamically, ensuring stability even for millions of years.

📦 Quick Start
Clone or download this repository.
Run the example test script:
python run_dpt.py


Example output:
Current UTC: 2025-11-09 03:41:32.059960+00:00
Current DPT: {'DPT_year': 7786, 'day': 231, 'pt_second': 817565.5228931528}
Reconstructed UTC from DPT: 2025-11-09 03:41:32.059960+00:00

🌍 Vision
DPT-Time aims to become the standardized digital clock
for autonomous systems and planetary-scale business logic.
It operates beyond cultural calendars — offering a neutral, mathematical time
for global synchronization, reporting, and AI governance.
